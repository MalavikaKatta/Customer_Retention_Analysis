# Customer Retention Analysis

## Overview
This analysis focuses on identifying key factors contributing to customer churn and providing strategic recommendations to improve retention.

## Key Findings
- **The First Two Months Are Crucial**: Most customer churn occurs within the first two months. Customers who remain beyond this period tend to become long-term users.
- **Customers Without Partners or Dependents**: These customers exhibit a higher likelihood of leaving compared to others.
- **Month-to-Month Plan Customers**: Customers on month-to-month plans experience significantly higher churn rates, making them a critical focus area.
- **Lack of Add-On Services**: Customers who do not subscribe to additional services (e.g., Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection) are more likely to churn.
